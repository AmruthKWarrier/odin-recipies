      In southern states of India namely Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,
      Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Sambar is made using different vegetables along
      with lentils or coconut. Each region has its own version of making sambar,
      even though the same vegetables are used, the condiments and ingredients,
      and the method differ regionwise. In Tulu speaking areas of coastal
      Karnataka coconut is predominantly used to prepare Koddel (Sambar), The
      grated coconut is ground with spices to form a paste which is added to
      vegetables boiled. In Kannada speaking regions sambar is referred to as
      Saaru.
